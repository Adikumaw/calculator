# Java Swing Calculator

This project is a dark-themed calculator built using Java and Swing. It features a fully responsive user interface, capable of performing multiple operations simultaneously with real-time result display. The code is organized into three distinct files: `Calculator`, `Logic`, and `UI`, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure.

## Features

- **Dark-Themed UI**: A sleek, modern look with a dark color scheme, easy on the eyes.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Real-Time Results**: Results are displayed in real-time as you input your calculations.
- **Multiple Operations**: Supports multiple mathematical operations in a single input.
- **Clean Code Structure**: The code is organized into three files:
  - `Calculator.java`: The main class that ties everything together.
  - `Logic.java`: Handles the core functionality and mathematical operations.
  - `UI.java`: Manages the user interface components and user interactions.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (Java's GUI toolkit)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/java-swing-calculator.git
   cd java-swing-calculator
   ```

2. **Compile the Code**  
   Use a Java compiler to compile the `.java` files:
   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java
   ```

3. **Run the Calculator**  
   Execute the compiled `Calculator` class:
   ```bash
   java Calculator
   ```

## Usage

- **Basic Operations**: Perform standard arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Real-Time Calculations**: View results in real-time as you type in numbers and operations.
- **Multiple Operations**: Input a sequence of operations to see the result computed in one go.

## Customization

- **Theme**: The dark theme can be modified by adjusting the color settings in the `UI.java` file.
- **Functionality**: Additional functionalities can be added by expanding the `Logic.java` file.
