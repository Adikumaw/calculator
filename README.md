# Java Swing Calculator

This project is a dark-themed calculator built using Java and Swing. It features a fully responsive user interface, capable of performing multiple operations simultaneously with real-time result display. The code is organized into three distinct files: `Calculator`, `Logic`, and `UI`, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Customization

- **Theme**: The dark theme can be modified by adjusting the color settings in the `UI.java` file.
- **Functionality**: Additional functionalities can be added by expanding the `Logic.java` file.
